# ffmpeg-expo

Native FFmpeg support for Expo apps.

Use this package for on-device FFmpeg command execution, progress updates, logs, cancellation, and FFmpeg version information. Commands use upstream FFmpeg argument handling; available codecs, filters, formats, and protocols depend on the installed binary profile.

## Status

This project is not stable for production use yet. It is mostly a hobby project while the native implementation, packaging, and binary distribution are still being worked out.

Use `ffmpeg-expo@0.0.3` or newer. Versions before `0.0.3` are not expected to work.

## Features

- Android and iOS native FFmpeg binaries
- Upstream FFmpeg command parsing and execution
- Progress and log callbacks
- Session cancellation
- Typed complex filtergraph builder
- Expo config plugin
- TypeScript definitions
- LGPL-only FFmpeg build with no GPL codecs

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Expo SDK | `>=56.0.0` |
| React Native | `>=0.85.0` |
| React | `>=19.2.0` |
| Node.js | `>=22.13.0` |
| Android | Android 7.0+ / API 24+ |
| iOS | 16.4+ |

Expo Go is not supported because this package includes native code. Use an Expo development build or a prebuilt Expo native project.

Native project/toolchain requirements:

| Toolchain | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Swift | 5.9 |
| Java / Kotlin JVM target | 17 |
| C++ | C++17 |
| CMake | 3.22.1 |
| Android NDK | r25+|

React Native New Architecture, Fabric, TurboModules, and direct app-level JSI setup are not required. The package is implemented as an Expo Module and is loaded through `expo-modules-core`.

## Installation

```bash
npx expo install ffmpeg-expo
```

The package downloads prebuilt FFmpeg binaries during install.

### Preview And Custom Binaries

By default, postinstall downloads `ffmpeg-android.tar.gz` and, on macOS, `ffmpeg-ios.zip` from the GitHub release configured in `package.json`. The following environment variables override that default:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `EXPO_FFMPEG_BINARY_BASE_URL` | Base URL containing both archives. |
| `EXPO_FFMPEG_ANDROID_ARCHIVE_URL` | Complete Android archive URL; takes precedence over the base URL. |
| `EXPO_FFMPEG_IOS_ARCHIVE_URL` | Complete iOS archive URL; takes precedence over the base URL. |
| `EXPO_FFMPEG_ANDROID_ARCHIVE` | Local Android archive path; takes precedence over URL settings. Relative paths resolve from the directory where npm was invoked. |
| `EXPO_FFMPEG_IOS_ARCHIVE` | Local iOS archive path; takes precedence over URL settings. Relative paths resolve from the directory where npm was invoked. |
| `EXPO_FFMPEG_ANDROID_SHA256` | Expected Android archive SHA-256. When set, extraction only occurs after a match. |
| `EXPO_FFMPEG_IOS_SHA256` | Expected iOS archive SHA-256. When set, extraction only occurs after a match. |

Install a [pkg.pr.new](https://pkg.pr.new/) preview while using binary archives from a preview host:

```bash
EXPO_FFMPEG_BINARY_BASE_URL=https://preview.example.com/ffmpeg/my-commit \
npm install https://pkg.pr.new/ffmpeg-expo@<commit>
```

The base URL must expose `/ffmpeg-android.tar.gz` and `/ffmpeg-ios.zip`. Use the per-platform URL variables when the archive URLs do not share that layout:

```bash
EXPO_FFMPEG_ANDROID_ARCHIVE_URL=https://preview.example.com/android.tar.gz \
EXPO_FFMPEG_ANDROID_SHA256=<64-character-sha256> \
npm install https://pkg.pr.new/ffmpeg-expo@<commit>
```

To test a packed npm tarball without publishing a release, provide local binary archives when installing it. On macOS, set both archives; on Linux, only Android is installed:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/expo-ffmpeg pack
EXPO_FFMPEG_ANDROID_ARCHIVE=/absolute/path/ffmpeg-android.tar.gz \
EXPO_FFMPEG_IOS_ARCHIVE=/absolute/path/ffmpeg-ios.zip \
npm install /absolute/path/ffmpeg-expo-0.1.0.tgz
```

Checksums are optional, but verification is required whenever the corresponding checksum variable is supplied. Temporary archive copies are removed after success or failure. Existing `SKIP_FFMPEG_DOWNLOAD=1` behavior still skips all setup.

## Expo Setup

Add the config plugin, then run prebuild.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "ffmpeg-expo",
        {
          "includeX86": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

### Plugin Options

| Option | Default | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `includeX86` | `false` | Including Android x86_64 emulator binaries in generated ABI filters. |
| `ndkVersion` | unset | Optional Android NDK override. When unset, Expo/Android Gradle defaults are used. |
| `binaryUrl` | unset | Reserved/experimental. The plugin writes `EXPO_FFMPEG_BINARY_URL` into iOS Podfile properties; use the postinstall environment variables above for binary installation. |

`app.config.js` example:

```javascript
export default {
  expo: {
    plugins: [
      [
        'ffmpeg-expo',
        {
          includeX86: true,
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
};
```

The config plugin does not change FFmpeg codec support. Custom codec builds require custom binaries.

Do not rely on the plugin's `binaryUrl` for postinstall downloads; use `EXPO_FFMPEG_BINARY_BASE_URL` or the per-platform overrides above.

## Usage

### Basic Remux

```typescript
import { execute, FFmpegError } from 'ffmpeg-expo';

async function remux(inputPath: string, outputPath: string) {
  try {
    const result = await execute(['-i', inputPath, '-y', outputPath]);
    console.log('Finished', result.returnCode, result.duration);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof FFmpegError) {
      console.error('FFmpeg failed:', error.returnCode, error.output);
    }
  }
}
```

### Complex Filtergraphs

`FilterGraphBuilder` serializes labels, chains, and filter options without adding shell quoting. Named option objects and positional option arrays are escaped for both FFmpeg filter-option and filtergraph parsing.

```typescript
import { execute, FilterGraphBuilder } from 'ffmpeg-expo';

const graph = new FilterGraphBuilder().addChain({
  inputs: '0:v',
  filters: [
    { name: 'scale', options: { w: 1280, h: -2 } },
    { name: 'fps', options: [30] },
  ],
  outputs: 'video',
});

await execute([
  '-i', inputPath,
  ...graph.buildArgs(),
  '-map', '[video]',
  '-y', outputPath,
]);
```

Use `addChain` for escaped, structured filterchains. `addRawChain` accepts a complete filterchain without validation or escaping for syntax that cannot be represented by the typed API.

### Progress And Logs

```typescript
import { run } from 'ffmpeg-expo';

function remuxWithProgress(inputPath: string, outputPath: string) {
  const session = run(['-i', inputPath, '-y', outputPath], {
    onProgress: (progress) => {
      console.log(`Processed: ${progress.time}ms`);
      console.log(`Speed: ${progress.speed}x`);
    },
    onLog: (log) => {
      console.log(`[${log.level}] ${log.message}`);
    },
    logLevel: 'info',
  });

  return session.result;
}
```

Progress events include `sessionId`, `time`, `bitrate`, `speed`, `frame`, `fps`, and `size`. The TypeScript `FFmpegProgress.totalDuration` field is reserved for future native duration reporting and is not emitted by the current Android or iOS implementation.

### Cancellation

```typescript
const session = run(['-i', inputPath, '-y', outputPath]);

await session.cancel();
const result = await session.result;
```

Cancelled sessions finish with return code `255`. Partial output files are not deleted automatically.

### FFmpeg Version

```typescript
import { getVersion } from 'ffmpeg-expo';

const version = getVersion();
console.log(`FFmpeg ${version.version}`);
```

## API

### `run(args, options?)`

Starts a session and returns:

- `id`: session identifier.
- `cancel()`: requests cancellation.
- `result`: promise that resolves with the session result.

Supported command shape:

```typescript
run(['-i', inputPath, '-y', outputPath]);
```

### `execute(args, options?)`

Runs a command and resolves with the result. Throws `FFmpegError` when FFmpeg returns a non-zero code.

### `FilterGraphBuilder`

Builds a complex filtergraph for use with `run` or `execute`.

- `addChain({ inputs?, filters, outputs? })` adds a typed filterchain.
- `addRawChain(fragment)` adds an unescaped filterchain.
- `build()` returns the graph string.
- `buildArgs()` returns `['-filter_complex', graph]`.

### `RunOptions`

| Option | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `onProgress` | Supported. Receives native progress events when FFmpeg emits parseable progress. |
| `onLog` | Supported. Receives native log events. |
| `logLevel` | Supported. Defaults to `warning`. |
| `env` | Reserved/not ready. It remains in the TypeScript API, but the current native implementations do not apply environment variables to the FFmpeg process. |

### `getVersion()`

Returns FFmpeg version information.

## Default Codec Support

The default `min` binaries are LGPL-only. The command frontend supports normal FFmpeg arguments, but commands can only use components enabled in this profile. It does not include GPL or external codec libraries such as `libx264`, `libx265`, `libmp3lame`, `libvpx`, `libopus`, `libvorbis`, `libass`, or `libdav1d`.

This means common recipes such as video compression with `libx264`, video to MP3, video to FLAC, H.264 to H.265, H.264 to VP9, subtitles, and multi-track mapping are not supported by default.

Compact binary component summary:

| Area | Included in default binaries | Not included / not ready by default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decoding / demuxing | Common AAC, AC3, H.264, HEVC, MP3, MPEG-4, Vorbis, Opus, FLAC, PCM, VP8/VP9, MP4/MOV, Matroska/WebM, WAV/OGG inputs | Subtitle demux/encode workflows are not enabled or validated. |
| Encoding / muxing | AAC, MPEG-4, PCM, MP4/MOV, Matroska/WebM, WAV/OGG outputs; Android also includes GIF/PNG/MJPEG image outputs | MP3, FLAC, H.265, VP9, Opus, Vorbis, and libx264/libx265/libvpx-backed encoding are not included. |
| Filters | Basic built-in filters such as `scale`, `trim`, `volume`, `fps`, `format`, and `concat`; Android also includes `overlay` and `drawtext` | Subtitle hardcoding and `libass` workflows are not included. |

For the detailed binary build configuration, see [BUILDING_BINARIES.md](https://github.com/kingjnr4/ffmpeg-expo/blob/main/packages/expo-ffmpeg/docs/BUILDING_BINARIES.md).

## Platform Binaries

| Platform | Architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Android | `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64` |
| iOS | `arm64` device, `arm64` + `x86_64` simulator |

## Troubleshooting

### Binaries not found

Run the install script again from the installed package:

```bash
node scripts/postinstall.js
```

The expected release assets are `ffmpeg-android.tar.gz` and `ffmpeg-ios.zip`.

### Android build errors

Check that your Android project uses a compatible NDK and ABI filters. The plugin only writes an NDK version when `ndkVersion` is explicitly configured.

### iOS build errors

Run CocoaPods after native project generation or package updates:

```bash
cd ios && pod install --repo-update
```
